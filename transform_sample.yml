# This is a sample file showing the format of the transformation file.
# Lines preceded by a '#' are comments and are ignored.
# In YAML, indentation is very important.
# If a key and its value are on multiple lines, the value must be indented 2 spaces
# ahead of key's indentation level.

# This is the national image near the top of the newsletter
top:
  image: National/07.14.2017/071417_National.jpg
  # The image can be a full path (e.g. http://st1.bgr.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cat-facebook.png)
  # Or it can be relative path that will be interpreted as a location on the eNP server
  # (e.g. https://ismailiinsight.org/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000001/National/07.14.2017/071417_National.jpg)
  caption: The top identifier is special since it requires an image and a caption and nothing else.

# This will search for the first article named 'Retitling' and apply the specified transformations to it.
Retitling:
  title: The title specifier takes a content descriptor or a list of content descriptors.

Body Specifiers:
  body:
  # All except the title specifier, modify the body of the identified article.
    - All of the specifiers except the title specifier take in a list of paragraphs.
    -
      - 'Each paragraph can be a '
      - content descriptor
      - ' or a '
      - list of content descriptors
      - .

  left:
    -
      - The left and right specifiers must appear together. If they are both present,
      - ' only these 2 specifiers will be applied even if there are any other body specifiers.'
      - The left and right specifiers split the body into 2 columns and each column
      - ' can have its own content (i.e. list of paragraphs).'
  right:
    - These specifiers are usually used to provide an image beside the content instead of above it.

Content Descriptors:
  body:
    -
      - For all descriptors with a seperate text property, that property is optional.
      - ' The caption property of the image descriptor functions in the same manner as the text property. '
      - Any thing that is displayed on the screen can be specified by a content descriptor
      - ' or a list of content descriptors.'
    - This is a text literal content descriptor.

      text: Opens the file in a new window. If not provided, this defaults to the file name (e. g. 071417_National.jpg).
      # Similar to the image source, the file descriptor can contain a relative path on the eNP server
      # or it can contain the full path to the file.

        - ' or a '
